- There are total of 45 state and the 10 top performing of them in terms of revenue are; Califonia, Texas, Illinois, Florida, New York, Indiana, Colorado, Arizona, Connecticut and North Carolina.
- There is a positive correlation between population, median income and revenue. There is high revenue where there is a high population and median income just like the case of Carolina and New York.

  
## Result and Insights

Based on the results of the analysis, the following insights were derived:
- The total revenue generated by the DTML retail store is 44.37m and 12.68m profit.
- May and January are the best performing months in terms of revenue.
- Decorative is the best selling product category with over 30% revenue.
- The top 5 products by revenue are clock, vases, clockware, ornaments and phone


## Recommendation

It is therefore recommended that:
- More advertisement and discounts should be done during January and May to increase sales.ðŸ˜„
- Decorative products should be givrn more atention over other products because it generate over one-quarter of the total revenue.
- Promotion and incentives should be given to the the best performing sales team to motivate them to do more and to bring sales competition among the sales team.
- State with high population and median income should be most targeted for sales for more revenue.

## Limitation

The dataset doesn't cover all the months of the year. So certain generalizations can not be made.ðŸ˜
